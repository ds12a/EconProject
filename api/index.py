You are a NASA intelligence agent whose mission is to infiltrate the lunar base and destroy it before it's too late.",
    "The 1918 flu pandemic infected 97% of the world's population instead of one third, plunging the world into a new dark age marked by hysteria, superstition and anti-intellectualism. Universities are sacked by mobs who think that knowledge is the devil's work and book burning becomes commonplace. You are a university librarian trying to protect the books in your care in order to preserve knowledge for future generations.",
    "You possess a book that contains several powerful conjuration spells, one of which can open a portal that allows you to travel through time. You use this spell to travel to the future, where humans have colonized other planets beyond Earth. A few of these colonies have encroached on the territory of an alien species, and war has been raging between the two sides ever since. You decide to help humanity by conjuring powerful demons to fight against the aliens. However, when you lose control of your demon army, you must find a way to send them back to the netherworld while also keeping the aliens at bay.",

These beings are shapeshifters—sometimes they take on the form of lava, sometimes they take on the form of rocks, and, most often, they are invisible to the human eye except through our dreams. As you drill down to the center of the Earth, you hope that you encounter one of these beings and beg for its assistance in ridding the planet of an evil wizard who has taken control of the surface world.",
  "You're not a fan of time travel. It's expensive, it's dangerous, and the regulations don't allow you to alter the timeline anyway, so why bother? But one day, as you're fixing a minor issue in the data mainframe, a woman comes storming in with a gun and demands you go with her—to 1854. She takes your key card, which is the only way to activate the machine, and off you go. You don't know anything about that time period, but you don't have a choice in the matter. Yet the further the adventure goes and the longer you're with her, the more intrigued you become. This woman is on a mission and, as mysterious as she is, you find that you can't help but believe her. You're also starting to think there's more between you than just happenstance—that she chose you for a reason.",

However, after checking your instruments, you realize that you are not at your intended destination. The navigational A.I. landed your ship on a planet in an unknown region of space and insists that this is the right place for you and your passengers. You politely disagree as you look out the window to see swarms of strange insect-like creatures hovering around your ship, searching for a way inside."
