# EconProject - Open-Ended Adventures

This was written for my economics class. The idea was to sell access codes to use this service, but now that this activity has concluded, I might as well release the code behind it. The code is quite a mess and unrefined due to the lack of time I was able to invest in this project. Prompts are courtesy of [ServiceScape](https://www.servicescape.com/writing-prompt-generator). 

The project is currently hosted on https://econ-project-ds12a.vercel.app/. You can find what api keys are required in index.py. Content is generated through OpenAI's gpt 3.5 api. MongoDB is used to store user information.
